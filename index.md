In these uncertain times, we decided to resurrect an old project, and start talking about the good things we've seen. Hence this.   
  
This is a podcast about interesting media. About ideas that might have had their day, but we think are worth reexamining. About things you might have heard of, and might not.   
  
We're [Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/) and [Tom Abba](https://twitter.com/tomabba), and we're both recovering academics and media scholars. This is our podcast.

(We're going to link to iTunes and Overcast here when those become available.)
