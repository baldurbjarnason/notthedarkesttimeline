About five years ago, we recorded a series of podcasts that discussed the book we'd written (link below). These petered out when Baldur moved to Montreal, and Tom started work on the [Ambient Literature](https://research.ambientlit.com/) project. 

This is a semi-sequel to those podcasts, and a reimagining of what we might want to talk about. It's also a reflection on the current state of things. Enjoy, and stay safe.
